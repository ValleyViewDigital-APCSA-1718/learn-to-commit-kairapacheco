* 1.1
public class Test
{
public static void main (String[] args)
{
System.out.println (“An Emergency Broadcast”);
}
}



* 1.3
public class test
{
public static void main (String[] args)
{
System.out.println("Name: Kaira Pacheco");
System.out.println("Name: February 24th 2001");
System.out.println("Name: I love to sleep.");
System.out.println("Name: Harry Potter series");
}
}



* 1.4

public class NameUpperCamelCase
{
        
    public static void main (String[] args)
    {
        System.out.println("\"Happiness can be found even in the darkest of Times if one simply remembers" +
        " to turn on the light\" ");
        System.out.println("Albus Dumbledore");

        
        
    } //EndMethodMain
    
} //EndClassNameUpperCamelCase



* 1.5
  public class test
  {
  public static void main (String[] args)
    {
    System.out.println("Name: Kaira Pacheco");
    System.out.println("Name: February 24th 2001");
    System.out.println("Name: I love to sleep.");
    System.out.println("Name: Harry Potter series");
    }
}



* Extra (If you did either one)
public class NameUpperCamelCase
{
        
    public static void main (String[] args)
    {
        System.out.println("\"I've always struggled to get out of bed");
        System.out.println("\tAs you cry out \"Mum\"");
        System.out.println("\t\tPlease let me rest my head");
        System.out.println("\tWe dress in our houses");
        System.out.println("\t\tWith grey and maroon");
        System.out.println("\tand smart skirts and glasses");
        System.out.println("Pity summer is over so soon!\"");

        
        
    } //EndMethodMain
    
} //EndClassNameUpperCamelCase
